## What is this? ##

This is a small pathfinding simulator in the form of a light HTML file along with javascript and css files.
The "finder" (person icon) will try to reach the flag in the grid.
The simulator has 3 tools that can be switched between:

- Grab: Click on finder or flag to move them.

- Draw: Click or hold down left mouse on tiles to draw walls the finder can't pass through.

- Erase: Click or hold down left mouse on wall tiles to destroy them.

The simulator has only been tested on Microsoft Edge on the PC, so bugs and incompatibilities may arise.

## Current State and Plans ##
Currently, the program only has basic A* pathfinding.
I am planning to add the ability to change what pathfinding algorithm is used
as well as optimizing A*.

Another feature that will definitely be implemented is the ability to see
the process of pathfinding step-by-step.
